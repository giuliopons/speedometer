# Custom speedometer built with Arduino Nano

This is a custom Arduino Nano speedometer for bikes.
The speedometer uses a reed sensor and a magnet on the bike wheel to count spins, calculating speed based on wheel circumference and spin count over time. It also displays distance, spin count, and elapsed time, controlled by buttons. Special features include using interrupts for spin detection, gradually changing speed numbers, and a case cover attached with magnets.
